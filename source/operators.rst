Operators and Expressions
=========================

.. role:: modelica(code)
   :language: modelica

The lexical units are combined to form even larger building blocks such
as expressions according to the rules given by the expression part of
the Modelica grammar in :ref:`TODO: Appendix B`.

This chapter describes the evaluation rules for expressions, the concept
of expression variability, built-in mathematical operators and
functions, and the built-in special Modelica operators with function
syntax.

Expressions can contain variables and constants, which have types,
predefined or user defined. The predefined built-in types of Modelica
are Real, Integer, Boolean, String, and enumeration types which are
presented in more detail in Section :ref:`predefined-types`.
[*The abbreviated predefined
type information below is given as background information for the rest
of the presentation.*\ ]

Expressions
-----------

Modelica equations, assignments and declaration equations contain
expressions.

Expressions can contain basic operations, ``+, -, *, /, ^``, etc. with
normal precedence as defined in :numref:`table-operators` and the grammar
in Section :ref:`modelica-concrete-syntax`. The semantics of the operations is defined for both
scalar and array arguments in :ref:`TODO: Section 10.6`.

It is also possible to define functions and call them in a normal
fashion. The function call syntax for both positional and named
arguments is described in :ref:`TODO: Section 12.4.1` and for vectorized calls in
:ref:`TODO: Section 12.4.4`. The built-in array functions are given in :ref:`TODO: Section 10.1.1`
and other built-in operators in Section :ref:`builtin-with-function-syntax`.

Operator Precedence and Associativity
-------------------------------------

Operator precedence determines the order of evaluation of operators in
an expression. An operator with higher precedence is evaluated before an
operator with lower precedence in the same expression.

The following table presents all the expression operators in order of
precedence from highest to lowest, as derived from the Modelica grammar
in :ref:`TODO: Appendix B`. All operators are binary except the postfix operators and
those shown as unary together with *expr*, the conditional operator, the
array construction operator ``{}`` and concatenation operator ``[]``, and the
array range constructor ``:`` which is either binary or ternary. Operators
with the same precedence occur at the same line of the table:

  +------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------+

The conditional operator may also include elseif-clauses. Equality = and
assignment := are not expression operators since they are allowed only
in equations and in assignment statements respectively. All binary
expression operators are left associative, except exponentiation which
is non-associative. The array range operator is non-associative.

[*The unary minus and plus in Modelica is slightly different than in
Mathematica and in MATLAB*\  [#matlab-mathematica]_\ *, since the following expressions
are illegal (whereas in Mathematica and in MATLAB these are
valid expressions):*

``2*-2 // = -4`` in Mathematica/MATLAB; is illegal in Modelica

``--2 // = 2`` in Mathematica/MATLAB; is illegal in Modelica

``++2 // = 2`` in Mathematica/MATLAB; is illegal in Modelica

``2--2 // = 4`` in Mathematica/MATLAB; is illegal in Modelica

*Non-associative exponentation and array range operator:*

``x^y^z`` Not legal, use parenthesis to make it clear.

``a:b:c:d:e:f:g`` Not legal, and scalar arguments gives no legal interpretation.

.. _evaluation-order :

Evaluation Order
----------------

A tool is free to solve equations, reorder expressions and to not
evaluate expressions if their values do not influence the result (e.g.
short-circuit evaluation of Boolean expressions). If-statements and
if-expressions guarantee that their clauses are only evaluated if the
appropriate condition is true, but relational operators generating state
or time events will during continuous integration have the value from
the most recent event.

If a numeric operation overflows the result is undefined. For literals
it is recommended to automatically convert the number to another type
with greater precision.

Example: Guarding Expressions Against Incorrect Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[*Example. If one wants to guard an expression against incorrect
evaluation, it should be guarded by an if:*

.. code-block :: modelica

    Boolean v[n];
    Boolean b;
    Integer I;
  equation
    x=v[I] and (I>=1 and I<=n); // Invalid
    x=if (I>=1 and I<=n) then v[I] else false; // Correct

*To guard square against square root of negative number use*
noEvent\ *:*

.. code-block :: modelica

  der(h)=if h>0 then -c*sqrt(h) else 0; // Incorrect
  der(h)=if noEvent(h>0) then -c*sqrt(h) else 0; // Correct

]

Arithmetic Operators
--------------------

Modelica supports five binary arithmetic operators that operate on any
numerical type:

+-------+------------------+
| ``^`` | Exponentiation   |
+-------+------------------+
| ``*`` | Multiplication   |
+-------+------------------+
| ``/`` | Division         |
+-------+------------------+
| ``+`` | Addition         |
+-------+------------------+
| ``-`` | Subtraction      |
+-------+------------------+

Some of these operators can also be applied to a combination of a scalar
type and an array type, see Section :ref:`TODO: 10.6`.

The syntax of these operators is defined by the following rules from the
Modelica grammar:

.. code-block :: ebnf

  arithmetic_expression =
    [ add_op ] term { add_op term } ;

  add_op =
    "+" | "-" ;

  term =
    factor { mul_op factor } ;

  mul_op =
    "*" | "/" ;

  factor =
    primary [ "^" primary ] ;

.. _eq-relational-logic-operators :

Equality, Relational, and Logical Operators
-------------------------------------------

Modelica supports the standard set of relational and logical operators,
all of which produce the standard boolean values true or false.

+----------+-------------------------------+
| ``>``    | greater than                  |
+----------+-------------------------------+
| ``>=``   | greater than or equal         |
+----------+-------------------------------+
| ``<``    | less than                     |
+----------+-------------------------------+
| ``<=``   | less than or equal to         |
+----------+-------------------------------+
| ``==``   | equality within expressions   |
+----------+-------------------------------+
| ``<>``   | Inequality                    |
+----------+-------------------------------+

A single equals sign ``=`` is never used in relational expressions, only in
equations (:ref:`TODO: Chapter 8, Section 10.6.1`) and in function calls using named
parameter passing (:ref:`TODO: Section 12.4.1`).

The following logical operators are defined:

+-----------+----------------------------+
| ``not``   | negation, unary operator   |
+-----------+----------------------------+
| ``and``   | logical and                |
+-----------+----------------------------+
| ``or``    | logical or                 |
+-----------+----------------------------+

The grammar rules define the syntax of the relational and logical
operators.

.. code-block :: ebnf

  logical_expression =
    logical_term { or logical_term } ;
  logical_term =
    logical_factor { and logical_factor } ;
  logical_factor =
    [ not ] relation ;
  relation =
    arithmetic_expression [ rel_op arithmetic_expression ] ;
  rel_op =
    "<" | ( "<=" ) | ">" | ( ">=" ) | ( "==" ) | ( "<>" ) ;

The following holds for relational operators:

-  Relational operators ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``==``, <>``, are only defined for
   scalar operands of simple types. The result is Boolean and is ``true`` or
   ``false`` if the relation is fulfilled or not, respectively.

-  For operands of type String, str1 op str2 is for each relational
   operator, op, defined in terms of the C-function strcmp as
   strcmp(str1,str2) op 0.

-  For operands of type Boolean, ``false<true``.

-  For operands of enumeration types, the order is given by the order of
   declaration of the enumeration literals.

-  In relations of the form ``v1 == v2`` or ``v1 <> v2``, ``v1 or v2`` shall, unless
   used in a function, not be a subtype of Real. [*The reason for this
   rule is that relations with Real arguments are transformed to state
   events (see Events, Section* 8.5\ *) and this transformation becomes
   unnecessarily complicated for the == and <> relational operators
   (e.g. two crossing functions instead of one crossing function needed,
   epsilon strategy needed even at event instants). Furthermore, testing
   on equality of Real variables is questionable on machines where the
   number length in registers is different to number length in main
   memory*].

-  Relations of the form ``v1 rel_op v2``, with v1 and v2 variables and
   rel\_op a relational operator are called elementary relations. If
   either v1 or v2 or both variables are a subtype of Real, the relation
   is called a Real elementary relation.

Miscellaneous Operators and Variables
-------------------------------------

Modelica also contains a few built-in operators which are not standard
arithmetic, relational, or logical operators. These are described below,
including time, which is a built-in variable, not an operator.

String Concatenation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Concatenation of strings (see the Modelica grammar) is denoted by the +
operator in Modelica [*e.g.* ``"a" + "b"`` *becomes* ``"ab"``].

Array Constructor Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The array constructor operator ``{ ... }`` is described in :ref:`TODO: Section 10.4`.

Array Concatenation Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The array concatenation operator ``[ ... ]`` is described in :ref:`TODO: Section 10.4.2`.

Array Range Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The array range constructor operator ``:`` is described in :ref:`TODO: Section 10.4.3`.

If-Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An expression

.. code-block :: modelica

  if expression1 then expression2 else expression3

is one example of if-expression. First expression1, which must be
boolean expression, is evaluated. If expression1 is true expression2 is
evaluated and is the value of the if-expression, else expression3 is
evaluated and is the value of the if-expression. The two expressions,
expression2 and expression3, must be type compatible expressions
(:ref:`TODO: Section 6.6`) giving the type of the if-expression. If-expressions with
elseif are defined by replacing elseif by else if. [*Note:* elseif *has
been added for symmetry with if-clauses.*] For short-circuit evaluation
see Section :ref:`evaluation-order`.

[*Example*:

.. code-block :: modelica

  Integer i;
  Integer sign_of_i1=if i<0 then -1 elseif i==0 then 0 else 1;
  Integer sign_of_i2=if i<0 then -1 else if i==0 then 0 else 1;

]

Member Access Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to access members of a class instance using dot notation,
i.e., the ``.`` operator.

[*Example:* ``R1.R`` *for accessing the resistance component* ``R`` *of
resistor* ``R1`` *. Another use of dot notation: local classes which are
members of a class can of course also be accessed using dot notation on
the name of the class, not on instances of the class.*]

Built-in Variable time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All declared variables are functions of the independent variable time.
The variable time is a built-in variable available in all models and
blocks, which is treated as an input variable. It is implicitly defined
as:

.. code-block :: modelica

  input Real time (final quantity = "Time", final unit = "s");

The value of the start attribute of time is set to the time instant at
which the simulation is started.

[*Example*:

.. code-block :: modelica

  encapsulated model SineSource
    import Modelica.Math.sin;
    connector OutPort=output Real;
    OutPort y=sin(time); // Uses the built-in variable time.
  end SineSource;

]

.. _builtin-with-function-syntax :

Built-in Intrinsic Operators with Function Syntax
-------------------------------------------------

Certain built-in operators of Modelica have the same syntax as a
function call. However, they do not behave as a mathematical function,
because the result depends not only on the input arguments but also on
the status of the simulation.

There are also built-in functions that depend only on the input
argument, but also may trigger events in addition to returning a value.
Intrinsic means that they are defined at the Modelica language level,
not in the Modelica library. The following built-in intrinsic
operators/functions are available:

-  Mathematical functions and conversion functions, see Section :ref:`numeric-and-conversion-functions`
   below.

-  Derivative and special purpose operators with function syntax, see
   Section :ref:`derivative-special-purpose-operators` below.

-  Event-related operators with function syntax, see Section :ref:`event-related-operators`
   below.

-  Array operators/functions, see Section :ref:`TODO: 10.1.1`.

With exception of built-in operator ``String(...)``, all operators in this
section can only be called with positional arguments.

.. _numeric-and-conversion-functions :

Numeric Functions and Conversion Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following mathematical operators and functions, also including some
conversion functions, are predefined in Modelica, and are vectorizable
according to Section 12.4.6, except for the String function. The
functions which do not trigger events are described in the table below,
whereas the event-triggering mathematical functions are described in
Section :ref:`event-triggering-math-functions`.

.. _derivative-special-purpose-operators :

Derivative and Special Purpose Operators with Function Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following derivative operator and special purpose operators with
function syntax are predefined:

.. todo ::

  This is using a definition list for the operators. There are other alternatives (tables are not that nice).
  Definition lists can be referred to using links, like :ref:`der(expr) <operator-der>`, but the link will
  not be visible in the HTML. Could possibly be themed into the HTML in some way.

.. index ::
  single: keyword; der
  single: der

.. _operator-der :

``der(expr)``
  The time derivative of expr. If the expression expr is a scalar it
  needs to be a subtype of Real. The expression and all its subexpressions
  must be differentiable. If expr is an array, the operator is applied
  to all elements of the array. For non-scalar arguments the function is
  vectorized according to Section :ref:`TODO: 10.6.12`.
  [*For Real parameters and constants the result is a zero scalar or array of the same size as the variable.*]

``delay(expr,delayTime, delayMax)``, ``delay(expr,delayTime)``
  Returns: expr(time–delayTime) for time>time.start + delayTime and
  expr(time.start) for time <= time.start + delayTime.
  The arguments, i.e., expr, delayTime and delayMax, need to be subtypes of Real.
  DelayMax needs to be additionally a parameter expression.
  The following relation shall hold: 0 <= delayTime <= delayMax, otherwise an error occurs.
  If delayMax is not supplied in the argument list, delayTime need to be a parameter expression.
  See also Section :ref:`operator-delay`. For non-scalar arguments the function is vectorized according to Section :ref:`TODO: 10.6.12`.

``cardinality(c)``
  [*This is a deprecated operator. It should no longer be used, since it will be removed in one of the next Modelica releases.*]
  Returns the number of (inside and outside) occurrences of connector instance c in a connect-equation as an Integer number. See also Section :ref:`operator-cardinality`.

``homotopy(actual=actual, simplified=simplified)``
  The scalar expressions “actual” and “simplified” are subtypes of Real. A Modelica translator should map this operator into either of the two forms:

  #. Returns “actual” *[a trivial implementation]*.
  #. In order to solve algebraic systems of equations, the operator might during the solution process return a combination of the two arguments, ending at actual, *[e.g., actual\*lambda + simplified\*(1-lambda), where lambda is a homotopy parameter going from 0 to 1].*

  The solution must fulfill the equations for homotopy returning ``actual``.
  See also Section :ref:`operator-homotopy`. For non-scalar arguments the function is vectorized according to Section :ref:`TODO: 12.4.6`.

.. _operator-def-semiLinear :

``semiLinear(x, positiveSlope, negativeSlope)``
  Returns:
  ``if x>=0 then positiveSlope*x else negativeSlope*x``.
  The result is of type Real. See Section :ref:`operator-semiLinear` [*especially in the case when x = 0*].
  For non-scalar arguments the function is vectorized according to Section :ref:`TODO: 10.6.12`.

``inStream(v)``
  The operator ``inStream(v)`` is only allowed on stream variables v
  defined in stream connectors, and is the value of the stream variable v
  close to the connection point assuming that the flow is from the
  connection point into the component.
  This value is computed from the stream connection equations of the flow
  variables and of the stream variables. The operator is vectorizable.
  For more details see Section :ref:`TODO: 15.2`.

``actualStream(v)``
  The actualStream(v) operator returns the actual value of the stream variable v for any flow direction. The operator is vectorizable. For more details, see Section :ref:`TODO: 15.3`.

``spatialDistribution(in0, in1, x, pv, iP, iV)``
  The ``spatialDistribution(...)`` operator allows approximation of variable-speed transport of properties, see Section :ref:`operator-spatialDistribution`.

``getInstanceName()``
  Returns a string with the name of the model/block that is simulated, appended with the fully qualified name of the instance in which this function is called, see Section :ref:`operator-instancename`.

A few of these operators are described in more detail in the following.

.. _operator-delay :

delay
^^^^^

[*The* ``delay()`` *operator allows a numerical sound implementation by
interpolating in the (internal) integrator polynomials, as well as a
more simple realization by interpolating linearly in a buffer containing
past values of expression expr. Without further information, the
complete time history of the delayed signals needs to be stored, because
the delay time may change during simulation. To avoid excessive storage
requirements and to enhance efficiency, the maximum allowed delay time
has to be given via* ``delayMax``\ *.*

*This gives an upper bound on the values of the delayed signals which
have to be stored. For real-time simulation where fixed step size
integrators are used, this information is sufficient to allocate the
necessary storage for the internal buffer before the simulation starts.
For variable step size integrators, the buffer size is dynamic during
integration. In principle, a* delay *operator could break algebraic
loops. For simplicity, this is not supported because the minimum delay
time has to be give as additional argument to be fixed at compile time.
Furthermore, the maximum step size of the integrator is limited by this
minimum delay time in order to avoid extrapolation in the delay
buffer*.]

.. _operator-spatialDistribution :

spatialDistribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[*Many applications involve the modelling of variable-speed transport of
properties. One option to model this infinite-dimensional system is to
approximate it by an ODE, but this requires a large number of state
variables and might introduce either numerical diffusion or numerical
oscillations. Another option is to use a built-in operator that keeps
track of the spatial distribution of z(y, t), by suitable sampling,
interpolation, and shifting of the stored distribution. In this case,
the internal state of the operator is hidden from the ODE solver.*\ ]

The spatialDistribution() operator allows to approximate efficiently the
solution of the infinite-dimensional problem:

.. math ::

  {\partial z(y,t) \over \partial t} + v(t) {\partial z(y,t) \over \partial y} = 0.0

.. math ::

  z(0.0, t) = in_0(t) \text{ if } v >= 0

.. math ::

  z(1.0, t) = in_1(t) \text{ if } v < 0

where *z(y, t)* is the transported quantity, *y* is the normalized
spatial coordinate (0.0 ≤ *y* ≤ 1.0), *t* is the time,
*v*\ (*t*)=\ **der**\ (*x*) is the normalized transport velocity and the
boundary conditions are set at either *y* = 0.0 or *y* = 1.0, depending
on the sign of the velocity. The calling syntax is:

.. code-block :: modelica

  (out0, out1) = spatialDistribution(in0, in1, x, positiveVelocity,
    initialPoints = {0.0, 1.0},
    initialValues = {0.0, 0.0});

where in0, in1, out0, out1, x, v are all subtypes of Real,
positiveVelocity is a Boolean, initialPoints and initialValues are
arrays of subtypes of Real of equal size, containing the y coordinates
and the *z* values of a finite set of points describing the initial
distribution of *z*\ (*y, t0*). The out0 and out1 are given by the
solutions at *z(0.0, t)* and *z(1.0, t)*; and in0 and in1 are the
boundary conditions at *z(0.0, t)* and *z(1.0, t)* (at each point in
time only one of in0 and in1 is used). Elements in the initialPoints
array must be sorted in non-descending order. The operator can not be
vectorized according to the vectorization rules described in section
12.4.6. The operator can be vectorized only with respect to the
arguments in0 and in1 (which must have the same size), returning
vectorized outputs out0 and out1 of the same size; the arguments
initialPoints and initialValues are vectorized accordingly.

The solution, z(..), can be described in terms of characteristics:

= *z*\ (*y*, *t*), for all, as long as staying inside the domain.

This allows to directly compute the solution based on interpolating the
boundary conditions.

The ``spatialDistribution`` operator can be described in terms of the
pseudo-code given as a block:

.. code-block :: modelica
  :caption: Pseudo-code for spatialDistribution in terms of a block.

  block spatialDistribution
    input Real in0;
    input Real in1;
    input Real x;
    input Boolean positiveVelocity;
    parameter Real initialPoints(each min=0, each max=1)[:] = {0.0, 1.0};
    parameter Real initialValues[:] = {0.0, 0.0};
    output Real out0;
    output Real out1;
    protected
    Real points[:];
    Real values[:];
    Real x0;
    Integer m;
  algorithm
    if positiveVelocity then
      out1:=interpolate(points, values, 1-(x-x0));
      out0:=values[1]; // similar to in0 but avoiding algebraic loop
    else
      out0:=interpolate(points, values, (x-x0));
      out1:=values[end]; // similar to in1 but avoiding algebraic loop
    end if;
    when /* acceptedStep */ then
      if x>x0 then
        m:=size(points,1);
        while (if m>0 then points[m]+(x-x0)>=1 else false) then
          m:=m-1;
        end while;
        values:=cat(1, {in0}, values[1:m], {interpolate(points, values,1-(x-x0))} );
        points:=cat(1, {0}, points[1:m] .+ (x1-x0), {1} );
      elseif x<x0 then
        m:=1;
        while (if m<size(points,1) then points[m]+(x-x0)<=0 else false) then
          m:=m+1;
        end while;
        values:=cat(1, {interpolate(points, values, 0-(x-x0))},values[m:end],{in1});
        points:=cat(1, {0}, points[m:end] .+ (x1-x0), {1});
      end if;
      x0:=x;
    end when;
  initial algorithm
    x0:=x;
    points:=initialPoints;
    values:=initialValues;
  end spatialDistribution;

[*The infinite-dimensional problem stated above can then be formulated
in the following way:*

.. code-block :: modelica

  der(x) = v;
  (out0, out1) = spatialDistribution(in0, in1, x, v>=0, initialPoints, initialValues);

*Events are generated at the exact instants when the velocity changes
sign – if this is not needed, noEvent() can be used to suppress
event generation.*

*If the velocity is known to be always positive, then out0 can be
omitted, e.g.:*

.. code-block :: modelica

  der(x) = v;
  (,out1) = spatialDistribution(in0, 0, x, true, initialPoints, initialValues);

*Technically relevant use cases for the use of the*
spatialDistribution\ *() operator are modeling of electrical
transmission lines, pipelines and pipeline networks for gas, water and
district heating, sprinkler systems, impulse propagation in elongated
bodies, conveyor belts, and hydraulic systems. Vectorization is needed
for pipelines where more than one quantity is transported with velocity
v in the example above.*]

.. _operator-cardinality :

cardinality (deprecated)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[*The cardinality operator is deprecated for the following reasons and
will be removed in a future release:*

-  *Reflective operator may make early type checking more difficult.*

-  *Almost always abused in strange ways*

-  *Not used for Bond graphs even though it was originally introduced
   for that purpose.*

]

[*The* cardinality() *operator allows the definition of connection
dependent equations in a model, for example*:

.. code-block :: modelica

  connector Pin
    Real v;
    flow Real i;
  end Pin;

  model Resistor
    Pin p, n;
  equation
    assert(cardinality(p) > 0 and cardinality(n) > 0, "Connectors p and n of Resistor must be connected");
    // Equations of resistor ...
  end Resistor;

]

The cardinality is counted after removing conditional components. and
may not be applied to expandable connectors, elements in expandable
connectors, or to arrays of connectors (but can be applied to the scalar
elements of array of connectors). The cardinality operator should only
be used in the condition of assert and if-statements – that do not
contain connect (and similar operators – see section 8.3.3).

.. _operator-homotopy :

homotopy
^^^^^^^^

*[During the initialization phase of a dynamic simulation problem, it
often happens that large nonlinear systems of equations must be solved
by means of an iterative solver. The convergence of such solvers
critically depends on the choice of initial guesses for the unknown
variables. The process can be made more robust by providing an
alternative, simplified version of the model, such that convergence is
possible even without accurate initial guess values, and then by
continuously transforming the simplified model into the actual model.
This transformation can be formulated using expressions of this kind:*

.. code-block :: modelica

  lambda*actual + (1-lambda)*simplified

*in the formulation of the system equations, and is usually called a
homotopy transformation. If the simplified expression is chosen
carefully, the solution of the problem changes continuously with lambda,
so by taking small enough steps it is possible to eventually obtain the
solution of the actual problem.*

*The operator can be called with ordered arguments or preferably with
named arguments for improved readability.*

*It is recommended to perform (conceptually) one homotopy iteration over
the whole model, and not several homotopy iterations over the respective
non-linear algebraic equation systems. The reason is that the following
structure can be present:*

    | **w** = **f**\ :sub:`1`\ (**x**) // has homotopy operator
    | **0** = **f**\ :sub:`2`\ (der(**x**), **x**, **z**, **w**)

*Here, a non-linear equation system* **f**\ :sub:`2` *is present. The
homotopy operator is, however used on a variable that is an “input” to
the non-linear algebraic equation system, and modifies the
characteristics of the non-linear algebraic equation system. The only
useful way is to perform the homotopy iteration over* **f**\ :sub:`1`
*and* **f**\ :sub:`2` *together.*

*The suggested approach is “conceptual”, because more efficient
implementations are possible, e.g. by determining the smallest iteration
loop, that contains the equations of the first BLT block in which a
homotopy operator is present and all equations up to the last BLT block
that describes a non-linear algebraic equation system.*

*A trivial implementation of the homotopy operator is obtained by
defining the following function in the global scope:*

.. code-block :: modelica

  function homotopy
    input Real actual;
    input Real simplified;
    output Real y;
  algorithm
    y := actual;
  annotation(Inline = true);
  end homotopy;

*Example 1:*

*In electrical systems it is often difficult to solve non-linear
algebraic equations if switches are part of the algebraic loop. An
idealized diode model might be implemented in the following way, by
starting with a “flat” diode characteristic and then move with the
homotopy operator to the desired “steep” characteristic:*

.. code-block :: modelica

  model IdealDiode
    // ...
    parameter Real Goff = 1e-5;
    protected
    Real Goff_flat = max(0.01, Goff);
    Real Goff2;
  equation
    off = s < 0;
    Goff2 = homotopy(actual=Goff, simplified=Goff_flat);
    u = s*(if off then 1 else Ron2) + Vknee;
    i = s*(if off then Goff2 else 1 ) + Goff2*Vknee;
    // ...
  end IdealDiode;

*Example 2:*

*In electrical systems it is often useful that all voltage sources start
with zero voltage and all current sources with zero current, since
steady state initialization with zero sources can be easily obtained. A
typical voltage source would then be defined as:*

.. code-block :: modelica

  model ConstantVoltageSource
    extends Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Interfaces.OnePort;
    parameter Modelica.SIunits.Voltage V;
  equation
    v = homotopy(actual=V, simplified=0.0);
  end ConstantVoltageSource;

*Example 3:*

*In fluid system modelling, the pressure/flowrate relationships are
highly nonlinear due to the quadratic terms and due to the dependency on
fluid properties. A simplified linear model, tuned on the nominal
operating point, can be used to make the overall model less nonlinear
and thus easier to solve without accurate start values. Named arguments
are used here in order to further improve the readability.*

.. code-block :: modelica

  model PressureLoss
    import SI = Modelica.SIunits;
    // ...
    parameter SI.MassFlowRate m_flow_nominal "Nominal mass flow rate";
    parameter SI.Pressure dp_nominal "Nominal pressure drop";
    SI.Density rho "Upstream density";
    SI.DynamicViscosity lambda "Upstream viscosity";
  equation
    // ...
    m_flow = homotopy(actual = turbulentFlow_dp(dp, rho, lambda),
    simplified = dp/dp_nominal*m_flow_nominal);
    // ...
  end PressureLoss;

*Example 4:*

*Note that the homotopy operator **shall not** be used to combine
unrelated expressions, since this can generate singular systems from
combining two well-defined systems.*

.. code-block :: modelica

  model DoNotUse
    Real x;
    parameter Real x0 = 0;
  equation
    der(x) = 1-x;
  initial equation
    0 = homotopy(der(x), x - x0);
  end DoNotUse;

*The initial equation is expanded into*

.. code-block :: modelica

  0 = lambda*der(x) + (1-lambda)*(x-x0)

*and you can solve the two equations to give*

.. code-block :: modelica

  x = (lambda+(lambda-1)*x0)/(2*lambda - 1)

*which has the correct value of x0 at lambda = 0 and of 1 at lambda = 1,
but unfortunately has a singularity at lambda = 0.5.*

*]*

.. _operator-semilinear :

semiLinear
^^^^^^^^^^

(See definition of :ref:`semiLinear <operator-def-semiLinear>`). In some situations,
equations with the semiLinear() function become underdetermined if the
first argument (x) becomes zero, i.e., there are an infinite number of
solutions. It is recommended that the following rules are used to
transform the equations during the translation phase in order to select
one meaningful solution in such cases:

**Rule 1**: The equations

.. code-block :: modelica

  y = semiLinear(x, sa, s[1]);
  y = semiLinear(x, s[1], s[2]);
  y = semiLinear(x, s[2], s[3]);
  // ...
  y = semiLinear(x, s[n], sb);
  // ...

may be replaced by

.. code-block :: modelica

  s[1] = if x >= 0 then sa else sb
  s[2] = s[1];
  s[3] = s[2];
  // ...
  s[n] = s[n-1];
  y = semiLinear(x, sa, sb);

**Rule 2**: The equations

.. code-block :: modelica

  x = 0;
  y = 0;
  y = semiLinear(x, sa, sb);

may be replaced by

.. code-block :: modelica

  x = 0
  y = 0;
  sa = sb;

[*For symbolic transformations, the following property is useful (this
follows from the definition):*

.. code-block :: modelica

  semiLinear(m_flow, port_h, h);

*is identical to :*

.. code-block :: modelica

  -semiLinear(-m_flow, h, port_h);

*The* ``semiLinear`` *function is designed to handle reversing flow in fluid
systems, such as*

.. code-block :: modelica

  H_flow=semiLinear(m_flow, port.h, h);

*i.e., the enthalpy flow rate* ``H_flow`` *is computed from the mass flow
rate* ``m_flow`` *and the upstream specific enthalpy depending on the flow
direction.*

]

.. _operator-instancename :

getInstanceName
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Returns a string with the name of the model/block that is simulated,
appended with the fully qualified name of the instance in which this
function is called.

[*Example:*

.. code-block :: modelica

  package MyLib
    model Vehicle
    Engine engine;
    ...
    end Vehicle;

    model Engine
    Controller controller;
    ...
    end Engine;

    model Controller
    equation
    Modelica.Utilities.Streams.print("Info from: " + getInstanceName());
    end Controller;

.. _event-related-operators :

Event-Related Operators with Function Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following event-related operators with function syntax are
supported. The operators noEvent, pre, edge, and change, are
vectorizable according to Section 12.4.6

``initial()``
  Returns true during the initialization phase and false otherwise [*thereby triggering a time event at the beginning of a simulation*].
``terminal()``
  Returns true at the end of a successful analysis [*thereby ensuring an event at the end of successful simulation*].
``noEvent(expr)``
  Real elementary relations within expr are taken literally, i.e., no state or time event is triggered. See also Section :ref:`noevent-smooth` and Section 8.5.
``smooth(p, expr)``
  If p>=0 smooth(p,expr) returns expr and states that expr is p times
  continuously differentiable, i.e.: expr is continuous in all real
  variables appearing in the expression and all partial derivatives with
  respect to all appearing real variables exist and are continuous up to
  order p.
  The argument p should be a scalar integer parameter expression.
  The only allowed types for expr in smooth are: real expressions, arrays
  of allowed expressions, and records containing only components of
  allowed expressions. See also Section :ref:`noevent-smooth`.
``sample(start,interval)``
  Returns true and triggers time events at time instants
  ``start + i*interval(i=0,1, ...)``.
  During continuous integration the operator returns always false.
  The starting time start and the sample interval interval need to be
  parameter expressions and need to be a subtype of Real or Integer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

``pre(y)``
  Returns the "left limit" y(t\ :sup:`pre`) of variable y(t) at a time
  instant t. At an event instant, y(t\ :sup:`pre`) is the value of y
  after the last event iteration at time instant t (see comment below).
  The pre() operator can be applied if the following three conditions
  are fulfilled simultaneously:

  a. variable y is either a subtype of a simple type or is a record component
  b. y is a discrete-time expression
  c. the operator is *not* applied in a function class.

  [*Note: This can be applied to continuous-time variables in when-clauses,
  see Section* :ref:`discrete-time-expressions` *for the definition of discrete-time expression.*]
  The first value of pre(y) is determined in the initialization phase. See also Section :ref:`operator-pre`.

``edge(b)``
  Is expanded into ``(b and not pre(b))`` for Boolean variable ``b``.
  The same restrictions as for the ``pre()`` operator apply (e.g. not to be used in function classes).

``change(v)``
  Is expanded into ``(v<>pre(v))``.
  The same restrictions as for the ``pre()`` operator apply.

``reinit(x, expr)``
  In the body of a when clause, reinitializes ``x`` with ``expr`` at an event instant.
  ``x`` is a Real variable (or an array of Real variables) that is
  implicitly defined to have ``StateSelect.always`` [*so must be selected as a state, and it is an error, if this is not possible*].
  expr needs to be type-compatible with x.
  The ``reinit`` operator can only be applied once for the same variable
  - either as an individual variable or as part of an array of variables.
  It can only be applied in the body of a when clause in an equation section.
  See also Section :ref:`TODO: 8.3.6`.

A few of these operators are described in more detail in the following.

.. _operator-pre :

pre
^^^

A new event is triggered if at least for one variable ``v`` ``pre(v) <> v``
after the active model equations are evaluated at an event instant. In
this case the model is at once reevaluated. This evaluation sequence is
called “\ *event iteration*\ ”. The integration is restarted, if for all
v used in pre-operators the following condition holds: ``pre(v) == v``.

[*If* ``v`` *and* ``pre(v)`` *are only used in when-clauses, the translator
might mask event iteration for variable v since v cannot change during
event iteration. It is a “quality of implementation” to find the minimal
loops for event iteration, i.e., not all parts of the model need to be
reevaluated.*

*The language allows mixed algebraic systems of equations where the
unknown variables are of type Real, Integer, Boolean, or an enumeration.
These systems of equations can be solved by a global fix point iteration
scheme, similarly to the event iteration, by fixing the Boolean,
Integer, and/or enumeration unknowns during one iteration. Again, it is
a quality of implementation to solve these systems more efficiently,
e.g., by applying the fix point iteration scheme to a subset of the
model equations.*]

.. _noevent-smooth :

noEvent and smooth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The noEvent operator implies that real elementary expressions are taken
literally instead of generating crossing functions, Section :ref:`TODO: 8.5`.
The smooth operator should be used instead of noEvent, in order to avoid
events for efficiency reasons. A tool is free to not generate events for
expressions inside smooth. However, smooth does not guarantee that no
events will be generated, and thus it can be necessary to use noEvent
inside smooth. [*Note that* smooth *does not guarantee a smooth output
if any of the occurring variables change discontinuously.*]

[*Example*:

.. code-block :: modelica

  Real x,y,z;
  parameter Real p;
  equation
  x = if time<1 then 2 else time-2;
  z = smooth(0, if time<0 then 0 else time);
  y = smooth(1, noEvent(if x<0 then 0 else sqrt(x)*x));
  // noEvent is necessary.

Variability of Expressions
--------------------------

The concept of variability of an expression indicates to what extent the
expression can vary over time. See also Section :ref:`TODO: 4.4.4`
regarding the concept of variability.
There are four levels of variability of expressions, starting from the
least variable:

-  constant variability

-  parameter variability

-  discrete-time variability

-  continuous-time variability

For an assignment ``v:=expr`` or binding equation ``v=expr``, ``v`` must be declared
to be at least as variable as ``expr``.

-  The right-hand side expression in a binding equation [*that is*,
   ``expr`` ] of a parameter component and of the base type attributes
   [*such as* ``start``] needs to be a parameter or constant expression.

-  If ``v`` is a discrete-time component then ``expr`` needs to be a
   discrete-time expression.

Constant Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Constant expressions are:

-  Real, Integer, Boolean, String, and enumeration literals.

-  Variables declared as constant.

-  Except for the special built-in operators initial, terminal, der,
   edge, change, sample, and pre, a function or operator with constant
   subexpressions as argument (and no parameters defined in the
   function) is a constant expression.

Components declared as constant shall have an associated declaration
equation with a constant expression, if the constant is directly in the
simulation model, or used in the simulation model. The value of a
constant can be modified after it has been given a value, unless the
constant is declared final or modified with a final modifier. A constant
without an associated declaration equation can be given one by using a
modifier.

Parameter Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter expressions are:

-  Constant expressions.

-  Variables declared as parameter.

-  Except for the special built-in operators initial, terminal, der,
   edge, change, sample, and pre, a function or operator with parameter
   subexpressions is a parameter expression.

.. _discrete-time-expressions :

Discrete-Time Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discrete-time expressions are:

-  Parameter expressions.

-  Discrete-time variables, i.e., Integer, Boolean, String variables and
   enumeration variables, as well as Real variables assigned in
   when-clauses

-  Function calls where all input arguments of the function are
   discrete-time expressions.

-  Expressions where all the subexpressions are discrete-time
   expressions.

-  Expressions in the body of a when-clause, initial equation, or
   initial algorithm.

-  Unless inside noEvent: Ordered relations (``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``) if at least one
   operand is a subtype of Real (i.e. Real elementary relations, see
   Section :ref:`eq-relational-logic-operators`) and the functions ``ceil``,
   ``floor``, ``div``, ``mod``, ``rem``.
   These will generate events if at least one subexpression is not a
   discrete-time expression. [*In other words, relations inside* ``noEvent()`` \ *,
   such as* ``noEvent(x>1)``\ *, are not discrete-time expressions*].

-  The functions ``pre``, ``edge``, and ``change`` result in discrete-time
   expressions.

-  Expressions in functions behave as though they were discrete-time
   expressions.

For an equation ``expr1 = expr2`` where neither expression is of base type
Real, both expressions must be discrete-time expressions. For record
equations the equation is split into basic types before applying this
test. [*This restriction guarantees that the* ``noEvent()`` *operator cannot
be applied to* ``Boolean``\ *,* ``Integer``\ *,* ``String``\ *, or enumeration
equations outside of a when-clause, because then one of the two
expressions is not discrete-time*]

Inside an if-expression, if-clause, while-statement or for-clause, that
is controlled by a non-discrete-time (that is continuous-time, but not
discrete-time) switching expression and not in the body of a
when-clause, it is not legal to have assignments to discrete variables,
equations between discrete-time expressions, or real elementary
relations/functions that should generate events. [*This restriction is
necessary in order to guarantee that there all equations for discrete
variable are discrete-time expressions, and to ensure that crossing
functions do not become active between events.*\ ]

[*Example*:

.. code-block :: modelica

  model Constants
    parameter Real p1 = 1;
    constant Real c1 = p1 + 2; // error, no constant expression
    parameter Real p2 = p1 + 2; // fine
  end Constants;

  model Test
    Constants c1(p1=3); // fine
    Constants c2(p2=7); // fine, declaration equation can be modified
    Boolean b;
    Real x;
  equation
    b = noEvent(x > 1) // error, since b is a discrete-time expr. and
    // noEvent(x > 1) is not a discrete-time expr.
  end Test;

]

Continuous-Time Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All expressions are continuous-time expressions including constant,
parameter and discrete expressions. The term “non-discrete-time
expression” refers to expressions that are not constant, parameter or
discrete expressions.
